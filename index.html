This is <strong>me asking for help.</strong>

I am worried people are forgetting how to listen.
I am worried people are lonely, but not alone.
I am trying to seed bomb a game that is a riddle that is a puzzle that is a love letter.
I am working as fast as I can. ***
I am glad you are here.

* I had to start somewhere or I would forget where I was when I came back. I believe Hello, World is the appropriate contextual marker.
** I am also an artist/writer who likes code, so I am trying to write a ~something~ using minimal html, css, and js. I am a maximalist brutalist?
*** I am also teaching myself "how to github" in this so you can imagine how that is going. can you believe they just have a tab labeled "Issues" oh! This is a thing I have.
